# 🌌 My Universe: A Celestial Proposal

**My Universe** is a romantic, immersive web experience designed to help you ask *the big question* in a way they’ll never forget. It’s a multi-stage journey through the stars featuring elegant glassmorphism, smooth interactive animations, and a playful **“No”** button that simply refuses to be clicked.

Whether you’re proposing, asking someone to be your partner, or creating a once-in-a-lifetime moment, this project turns your feelings into an unforgettable experience.

## 🚀 Make It Yours (Easy Customization)

You don’t need to be a pro coder to personalize this project. Follow the steps below to transform the template into **your own universe**.

---

### 🎵 1. Change the Background Music

At the top of the `<body>` section, find the `<audio>` tag and replace the `src` with a **direct link** to your favorite song:

```html
<audio id="bgm" src="YOUR_DIRECT_MUSIC_LINK_HERE" loop></audio>
```

> 💡 Tip: Make sure the link points directly to an audio file (e.g. `.mp3`).

### 🖼️ 2. Add Your Photo

Navigate to **Screen 3** (around line 235). Replace the existing Unsplash image with a photo of you two:

```html
<div class="photo-frame" style="background-image:url('YOUR_IMAGE_LINK_HERE')"></div>
```

### 💌 3. Personalize the Love Notes

Search for `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` tags throughout the file to edit the text.

Make it truly yours:

* Add names
* Include inside jokes
* Reference shared memories
* Write from the heart 💖

---

### 🎨 4. Customize the Colors

At the top of the file, inside the `<style>` section, locate the `:root` variables:

```css
:root {
  --primary: #ff5fa2;   /* Main heart / accent color */
  --secondary: #8b5cf6; /* Glow and button color */
}
```

Change the hex values to match their favorite colors or your theme.
