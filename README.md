🌌 My Universe: A Celestial Proposal
This is a romantic, immersive web experience designed to help you ask that big question in a way they’ll never forget. It’s a multi-stage journey through the stars, featuring glassmorphism design, interactive animations, and a "No" button that refuses to be clicked.

🚀 How to Make It Yours
You don't need to be a pro coder to personalize this. Follow these simple steps to turn this template into your own "Universe":

1. Change the Music
Find the <audio> tag at the start of the <body> and swap the src with a link to your favorite song:

HTML
``<audio id="bgm" src="YOUR_DIRECT_MUSIC_LINK_HERE" loop></audio>``
2. Add Your Photo
Go to Screen 3 (around line 235) and replace the Unsplash link with a link to a photo of you two:

HTML
``<div class="photo-frame" style="background-image:url('YOUR_IMAGE_LINK_HERE')"></div>``
3. Edit the Love Notes
Search for the <h1>, <h2>, and <p> tags to change the text. You can make the messages more personal or include inside jokes.

4. Adjust the Colors
In the <style> section at the top, look for :root. You can change the hex codes to match her/his favorite colors:
--primary: The main pink/heart color.
--secondary: The glow and button colors.

🕹️ How to Deploy
Download the index.html file.
Host it for free using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
Send the link to your partner and wait for the "Yes"!

✨ Features
Shooting Stars: Randomly generated background animations.
The "No" Dodge: The "No" button moves away when they try to click it.
Fireworks: A colorful explosion of particles when they finally click "YES".
Mobile Friendly: Works beautifully on phones and desktops.

Good luck! May the stars be in your favor. 💖
